# This GitHub Workflow is used because, by default, the GitHub policy is to
# disable workflows for those repositories without activity within the last 60 days.
#
# So, this repository usually falls into that category, because we rarely update it.
# But, we want to keep the GitHub Workflow active to continue building the latest
# Go releases. So, we push an empty commit once a month (so it keeps active).
